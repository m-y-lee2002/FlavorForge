## Using Jira Scrum

### Backlogs
In Jira, we manage our backlog by categorizing issues into:
- **User Stories**: Features from the user's perspective.
- **Tasks**: Actionable items derived from user stories.
- **Bugs**: Issues that need resolution.

### Boards
We utilize Scrum boards to visualize our workflow, which includes the following stages:
- **To Do**: Tasks that are not yet started.
- **In Progress**: Tasks currently being worked on.
- **Done**: Completed tasks.

### Timelines
We create and manage timelines using:
- **Epics**: Large bodies of work that can be broken down into smaller tasks.
- **Sprints**: Time-boxed periods (typically 2 weeks) during which specific tasks are completed.

### Sprints
Our sprint process includes:
- **Sprint Planning**: Selecting items from the backlog for the upcoming sprint.
- **Daily Stand-ups**: Short meetings to discuss progress and blockers.
- **Sprint Review and Retrospective**: Reviewing completed work and discussing improvements.

## Reporting
We generate various reports in Jira to track our progress, including:
- **Burndown Charts**: Visual representation of work completed versus work remaining.
- **Sprint Reports**: Summary of the work completed during a sprint.
