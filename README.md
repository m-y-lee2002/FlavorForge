# My CookBook

## Description
This project aims to allow users to store recipes as well as information regarding those dishes. In the future may add functionality to allow for users to friend each other 
share recipes and view recipe collections. We utilize Jira Scrum to manage our workflow effectively, ensuring that we stay on track and meet our goals.

### High Fidelity Prototype: 
I have created a user interface design plan using Figma. You can explore the prototype through the link below:

## Using Jira Scrum

### Backlogs
In Jira, I manage the backlog by categorizing issues into:
- **User Stories**: Features from the user's perspective.
- **Tasks**: Actionable items derived from user stories.
- **Bugs**: Issues that need resolution.

### Boards
I utilize Scrum boards to visualize our workflow, which includes the following stages:
- **To Do**: Tasks that are not yet started.
- **In Progress**: Tasks currently being worked on.
- **Done**: Completed tasks.

### Timelines
I create and manage timelines using:
- **Epics**: Large bodies of work that can be broken down into smaller tasks.
- **Sprints**: Time-boxed periods (typically 2 weeks) during which specific tasks are completed.

**Current Timeline**

### Sprints
My sprint process includes:
- **Sprint Planning**: Selecting items from the backlog for the upcoming sprint.
- **Daily Progress Update**: Short modification of Jira timeline and necessary additions of Epics, Stories, Tasks, and Bugs.
- **Sprint Review and Retrospective**: Reviewing completed work and brainstorm potential improvements.

## Reporting
I generate various reports in Jira to track our progress, including:
- **Burndown Charts**: Visual representation of work completed versus work remaining.
- **Sprint Reports**: Summary of the work completed during a sprint.
